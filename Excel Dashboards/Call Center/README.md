The dashboard offers comprehensive visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into call data. The main features of the dashboard include:

KPIs: Displaying the total number of calls, average customer satisfaction score, and average call duration.
Line Chart: Depicting the trend of calls during October, the only month available in the dataset.

Column Chart: Representing the reasons for the calls.
Bar Chart: Indicating the response time.

Features Highlight:
A notable feature of the dashboard is the inclusion of slicers on the left side, providing interactivity by allowing users to filter the data. 

Getting Started:

1-Observe the Data: 
So, I took a good look at the data, checked every little part to make sure everything is in order. Noticed some things were a bit off, and fixed those.

2-Pivot Tables and Build Charts:
Then came the fun part â€“ creating pivot tables and whipping up those charts.

3- Building the Dashboard: 
Now, let's bring this dashboard to life! ðŸš€ I've meticulously designed it to be not just informative but interactive too, thanks to the magic of slicers.

The whole dashboard dances to your tune as you play around with these slicers. It's like having the power to reshape the narrative of the data at your fingertips. And the best part? It's surprisingly easy to use!
