Movie-Correlation-in-PYTHON
Overview
A little project made in Python, where we correlate different characteristic of movies to see if we can find what makes a great movie. Because we doesn't need any dashboards cuz we don't present our findings to any board team I choose to use Python and different libraries, for data cleaning, exploration and visualisation. In this way all things are in the same notebook.
